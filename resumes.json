The data comes from a variety of sources, including enterprise systems, traffic analysis, weather forecasts, location information, mobile internet and GPS enabled smartphones. Logistics is a dynamic and complex process which is prone to bottlenecks, particularly in the last mile of a supply chain.\n\nThe analytics group analyzed and addressed logistics optimization. The goal was to save money and time, avoid late delivery and manage utilization of resources. This included planning routes, managing employment and fleets. Data was utilized on destination locations, shipping area, parking and time of delivery to prevent backlogs at the unloading point, and ensure deliveries were made at a time when they could be received.\n\nProject Points:\n• Identified and executed process improvements, hands-on in various technologies such as Oracle, Informatica, and Business Objects.\n• Designed both 3NF data models for operational data store (ODS), online transaction processing (OLTP) systems and dimensional data models using Star and Snow Flake Schemas\n• Developed large data sets from structured and unstructured data.

The data comes from a variety of sources, including enterprise systems, traffic analysis, weather forecasts, location information, mobile internet and GPS enabled smartphones. Logistics is a dynamic and complex process which is prone to bottlenecks, particularly in the last mile of a supply chain.\n\nThe analytics group analyzed and addressed logistics optimization. The goal was to save money and time, avoid late delivery and manage utilization of resources. This included planning routes, managing employment and fleets. Data was utilized on destination locations, shipping area, parking and time of delivery to prevent backlogs at the unloading point, and ensure deliveries were made at a time when they could be received.\n\nProject Points:\n• Identified and executed process improvements, hands-on in various technologies such as Oracle, Informatica, and Business Objects.\n• Designed both 3NF data models for operational data store (ODS), online transaction processing (OLTP) systems and dimensional data models using Star and Snow Flake Schemas\n• Developed large data sets from structured and unstructured data. Perform data mining.\n• Partnered with modeling experts to develop data frame requirements for projects.\n• Performed Ad-hoc reporting/customer profiling, segmentation using R/Python.\n• Created statistical models for the collected data, exploratory, pre-processing, to provide conclusions with decision guides.\n• Programmed a utility in Python that used multiple packages (scipy, numpy, pandas)\n• Implemented Classification using supervised algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision trees, KNN, Naive Bayes.\n• Validated machine learning classifiers using ROC Curves and Lift Charts.\n• Extracted data from HDFS and prepared data for exploratory analysis using data wrangling.\nUpdated Python scripts to match training data with database stored in AWS Cloud Search and assign each document a response label for further classification.\n\nData Scientist\n- Hyderabad May 2011 to December 2012","email":"","phoneNumber":"","additionalInformation":"strategic goals.
