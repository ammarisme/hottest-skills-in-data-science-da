Jackson Foundation","location":"Laurel, MD","summary":"http://jvschoen.epizy.com/CV.html - Digital CV\nhttp://jvschoen.epizy.com/cover.html - Digital Cover\n\nComing from a background in Biology, I have had immense amount of experience in experiment design and data analysis, which are strong skills required for Data Scientists. I have built data management, automation, and analysis tools using R, Python, LabKey, FileMaker Pro, and MySQL. I utilize packages like RShiny, and RMarkdown, and the tidyverse in R to generate statistical analyses and reporting in a static format or interactively. I have performed PCA analyses for feature reduction, various univariate frequentist statistical analyses (Fisher’s Exact/Chi-square, t-tests, Mann Witney), and linear regression analysis on immunological samples in clinical vaccine trial analyses. I generate visualizations for our internal experimentation, as well as for publications on the research we perform. I have training in Bayes statistics and Hidden Markov models and look forward to applying it in my future positions. \n\nI have recently been developing my skills in Python, since I know it is the go-to for machine learning. I work with numpy and pandas mostly, but have used scikit.learn so a small degree. Most of my coursework at JHU focusses on manually building the algorithms to get a better understanding of the process. I have worked on gradient descent for linear regression, as well as Winnow-2, Naïve Bayes, Bayesian networks, Hidden Markov. I look forward to utilizing these in my work moving forward. I have also built a small app as a project using Python Django, CGI and MySQL for one of my biological projects.\n\nSince I started my position in research, I have been drawn to data, from organization and management to analysis and visualization. My coursework at JHU for my MS in Bioinformatics has very much strengthened my urge to get into the field as a Data Scientist. Working in the Non-Profit Biology world has its limitations in data organization, which makes efficient large-scale analyses difficult. I want to be in an environment where I can work with large scale datasets that Industry has to offer. I get a thrill out of improving efficiency and productivity through automation tool development, data integrity, and organization, to make those munging stages seamless so I can spend more time digging into the data.\n\nI have management experience where I was able to utilize my interpersonal skills to improve communication and productivity of the team by leading as a member and not a director. I am a very hands-on person who is capable of communicating with a diverse set of departments and backgrounds comfortably. I hope to find a data science team where I can further develop my skills in the field and contribute to the expansion and development of the company with my diverse skillset.","email":"","phoneNumber":"","additionalInformation":"techniques (PCR, DNA prep, transformation, Cloning) GraphPad Prism and <span class=\"hl\">data</span> analysis Protein Production (MBP-fusion) Fluent in English, Thai and Spanish...
