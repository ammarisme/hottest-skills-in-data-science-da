There are three main families of iGluRs, AMPA, NMDA, and kainite which among other things differ in their responses to two endogenous neurosteroids, pregnenalone sulfate (PS) and pregnanalone sulfate (PREGAS). To investigate the role that conformational flexibility of the amino terminal domains play in response to the neurosteroids we have used Multiwavelength Collisional Quenching (MWCQ) which reports on the exposure and charge environment of tyrosines and tryptophans in the protein and gel filtration to assess the impacts of steroid binding on quaternary structure.

To investigate the role that conformational flexibility of the ligand binding domain plays in response to either glutamate or the neurosteroids (in the presence or absence of glutamate) we have used Multiwavelength Collisional Quenching (MWCQ) which reports on the exposure and charge environment of multiple tyrosines and tryptophans in the protein. While Glutamate has different effects on flexibility depending upon the family of receptor, the use of differently charged quenching molecules shows glutamate induced changes in the charge environment that can be correlated with steroid binding ability and that the presence of glutamate augments the effects of the steroid leading to enhanced global rigidity of the domains.

The results show that not only can detailed information about the local environment of tryptophans in proteins be obtained (even proteins with multiple tryptophans), but information is derived resulting from tyrosine-tryptophan resonance energy transfer in proteins... Using Acrylamide, Iodide and Cesium collisional quenchers with both tyrosine and tryptophan derivatives and with model proteins with one or more tryptophans we demonstrate the utility of the approach for defining the local environment and changes induced by ligand binding, Furthermore, during the course of these studies we revealed that pi-cation effects disrupt resonance energy transfer between tryptophan (acting as either donor or acceptor) and other moieties in the protein.

Participants with a range of proficiency in a second language were trained on a third language. They were presented with 20 Turkish words (to test word-learning) and their plural counterparts (to test rule-learning). After training, participants were asked to judge whether a given label correctly matched the pictured object (comprehension) and to verbally produce the correct label for a given object (production). The comprehension test took place immediately after training and again a week later. The production test was administered after the second comprehension test. We found that performance on the initial comprehension test was predicted by working memory span but not L2 proficiency; L2 proficiency predicted learning performance only for the delayed tests. This suggests that the two variables – L2 Proficiency and Working Memory – play different roles in L3 learning."},{"id":"EenkbxDNP7uuZbvK4EsAIg","title":"Reading in Spanish as a second language: An eye-tracking study","url":"http://www.readingmatrix.com/files/16-wn327906.pdf","displayDate":"2017-04","description":"In this study, we examined sentence processing for low-proficiency Spanish learners, as compared to high-proficiency speakers.
