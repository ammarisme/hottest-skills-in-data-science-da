distance migrations, either vertically in the water column or horizontally for 10 km (over 200 000 body lengths) per day. Hence efficient locomotory performance is crucial for their survival. We study the swimming kinematics of krill using a combination of experiment and analysis. We quantify the propulsor kinematics for tethered and freely swimming krill in experiments, and find kinematics that are very nearly metachronal. We then formulate a drag coefficient model which compares metachronal, synchronous and intermediate motions for a freely swimming body with two legs. With fixed leg velocity amplitude, metachronal kinematics give the highest average body speed for both linear and quadratic drag laws. The same result holds for five legs with the quadratic drag law. When metachronal kinematics is perturbed towards synchronous kinematics, an analysis shows that the velocity increase on the power stroke is outweighed by the velocity decrease on the recovery stroke. With fixed time-averaged work done by the legs, metachronal kinematics again gives the highest average body speed, although the advantage over synchronous kinematics is reduced."}],"highlightedWords":["data","scientists","datas","scientist"]},{"accountKey":"3929374a44d32390","id":"EekrHMqbiNmqUFn7OsNiYg","updatedDate":"September 22, 2019","fullName":"Data Scientist Intern","firstName":"Data Scientist Intern","headline":"Analytics Graduate Student in Northwestern University","location":"Evanston, IL","summary":"I am pursuing the Master degree of Science in Analytics at Northwestern University.

I am responsible for building a pipeline for an internally used email alert system, which sends daily reports of futures and options whose open interest or trading volume hit the historical top 10. After the pipeline is created, I test it with new functionality with analysis in geographical changes of the trading volume. I am deploying and testing this project in QA environment with Stash, JIRA and Nexus. I worked as a software developer in a financial service company in 2018 summer and quantitative researcher in a data service company in 2017. The diversity of internship experience helps me enhance skills in the data science area.\n\nI develop great enthusiasm for Data Science from my undergrad research and work experience. I had a 3-semester research experience on visualizing the pulse of traffic in NYC and analyzing the topological properties of the traffic flow based on persistence homology. Besides, I assisted to create a novel graphical model combining LDA and Gaussian vMF Mixture Model for classifying the short text.\n\nI am currently seeking a Data Scientist intern opportunity in 2019 summer.

In particular, the SW community/subreddit has nearly 40,000 subscribers and 13 human moderators who monitor for abusive comments among other things. Given comments on posts from users expressing suicidal thoughts can be written from any part of the world at any time, moderating in a timely manner can be tedious. Furthermore, Reddit's default comment ranking does not involve aspects that relate to the \"helpfulness\" of a comment from a suicide prevention (SP) perspective. Being able to automatically identify and score helpful comments from such a perspective can assist moderators, help SW posters to have immediate feedback on the SP relevance of a comment, and also provide insights to SP researchers for dealing with online aspects of SP. In this paper, we report what we believe is the first effort in automatic identification of helpful comments on online posts in SW forums with the SW subreddit as the use-case. We use a dataset of 3000 real SW comments and obtain SP researcher judgments regarding their helpfulness in the contexts of the corresponding original posts. We conduct supervised learning experiments with content based features including n-grams, word psychometric scores, and discourse relation graphs and report encouraging F-scores (? 80-90%) for the helpful comment classes. Our results indicate that machine learning approaches can offer complementary moderating functionality for SW posts. Furthermore, we realize assessing the helpfulness of comments on mental health related online posts is a nuanced topic and needs further attention from the SP research community."}],"highlightedWords":["data","scientists","datas","scientist"]},{"accountKey":"dcbaf99a1e38dac7","id":"EenN0Pv3ca6vysuqcmYuvw","updatedDate":"October 3, 2019","fullName":"Data Scientist Intern","firstName":"Data Scientist Intern","headline":"Data Scientist Intern","location":"Chicago, IL","summary":"","email":"","phoneNumber":"","additionalInformation":"TECHNICAL SKILLS: Statistical Tools\tR Studio, Anaconda Python, RapidMiner, SPSS,\tProgramming\tR, Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML 5, XML, Google Analytics...

The data comes from a variety of sources, including enterprise systems, traffic analysis, weather forecasts, location information, mobile internet and GPS enabled smartphones. Logistics is a dynamic and complex process which is prone to bottlenecks, particularly in the last mile of a supply chain. The analytics group analyzed and addressed logistics optimization. The goal was to save money and time, avoid late delivery and manage utilization of resources. This included planning routes, managing employment and fleets.
