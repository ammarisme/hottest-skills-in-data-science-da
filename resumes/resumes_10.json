The severity of anemia in the patients varied from compensated (i.e., no medical intervention required) to chronic transfusion dependence. Common characteristics of all patients included chronic elevation of reticulocyte count and a negative workup for anemia focusing on hemoglobinopathies, morphologic abnormalities that would suggest a membrane defect, immune-mediated red cell destruction, and evaluation of the most common red cell enzyme defects, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase deficiency. Based upon this initial workup and presentation during infancy or early childhood, four patients classified as hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA) of unknown etiology were selected for proteomic analysis. DIGE analysis of red cell cytosolic proteins clearly discriminated each anemic patient from both familial and unrelated controls, revealing both patient-specific and shared patterns of differential protein expression. Changes in expression pattern shared among the four patients were identified in several protein classes including chaperons, cytoskeletal and proteasome proteins. Elevated expression in patient samples of some proteins correlated with high reticulocyte count, likely identifying a subset of proteins that are normally lost during erythroid maturation, including proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism and protein synthesis. Proteins identified with patient-specific decreased expression included components of the glutathione synthetic pathway, antioxidant pathways, and proteins involved in signal transduction and nucleotide metabolism. Among the more than 200 proteins identified in this study are 21 proteins not previously described as part of the erythrocyte proteome. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying a global proteomic approach to aid characterization of red cells from patients with hereditary anemia of unknown cause, including the identification of differentially expressed proteins as potential candidates with a role in disease pathogenesis."},{"id":"EekqM9bCCUWnt9x7tzCqKQ","title":"Constitutive Nox4 activity resides in the composition of the B-loop and the penultimate C-terminus","url":"http://www.jbc.org/content/287/12/8737.full","displayDate":"2012-01","description":"Redox regulation of signaling molecules contributes critically to propagation of intracellular signals. The main source providing reactive oxygen species (ROS) for these physiological processes are activated NADPH oxidases (Nox/Duox family). In a pathophysiological context, some NADPH oxidase complexes produce large amounts of ROS either as part of the antimicrobial immune defense or as pathologic oxidative stress in many chronic diseases. Thus, understanding the switch from a dormant, inactive conformation to the active state of these enzymes will aid the development of inhibitors. As exogenously expressed Nox4 represents the only constitutively active enzyme in this family, analysis of structural determinants that permit this active conformation was undertaken. Our focus was directed toward a cell-based analysis of the first intracellular loop, the B-loop, and the C-terminus, two regions of Nox family enzymes that are essential for electron transfer. Mutagenesis of the B-loop identified several unique residues and a polybasic motif that contribute to the catalytic activity of Nox4. By using a multifaceted approach, including Nox4-Nox2 chimeras, mutagenesis, and insertion of Nox2 domains, we show here that the penultimate 22 amino acids of Nox4 are involved in constitutive ROS generation. The appropriate spacing of the C-terminal Nox4 sequence may cooperate with a discrete arginine-based interaction site in the B-loop, providing an intrinsically active interface that could not be disrupted by peptides derived from the Nox4 C-terminus. These results indicate that accessibility for a Nox4-specific peptide inhibitor might be difficult to achieve in vivo."},{"id":"EekqNAh1Rc6CUHQQHNWEsA","title":"A Novel Approach for In Vivo Measurement of Mouse Red Cell Redox Status.","url":"http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/118/13/3694?sso-checked=true","displayDate":"2011-03","description":"Maintenance of a reducing redox balance is a critical physiologic function of red cells (RBC) that can be perturbed in variety of RBC pathologies. Here we describe a new approach to evaluate in vivo RBC redox status using a redox sensitive GFP (roGFP2) sensor under control of a ?-globin mini-promoter, directing expression specifically to erythroid cells. RoGFP2 expressing RBCs demonstrate ratiometric and reversible shifts in fluorescence on exposure to oxidants and reductants. We demonstrate that roGFP2 expressing RBC can be used to monitor thiol redox status during in vitro phenylhydrazine treatment and over the course of in vivo RBC aging, where a shift to a more oxidized state is observed in older cells. Thus, roGFP2 transgenic mice are a new and versatile tool that can be used to probe how RBC redox status responds in the context of drug therapy, physiologic stressors and pathologic states."},{"id":"EekqNDJ4bh-wiIeEKom3Nw","title":"Erythropoietin, GDF15, IL6, Hepcidin and Testosterone Levels in a Large Cohort of Elderly Individuals with Anaemia of Known and Unknown Cause","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01631.x","displayDate":"2011-04","description":"Epidemiologic studies have documented an increasing frequency of anaemia in individuals 65?yrs and older. Elderly individuals with anaemia have been categorised into the following: those with chronic disease, those with iron, B12 or folate deficiency and those with anaemia of unknown aetiology (AUE). There is considerable interest and debate as to whether AUE has an inflammatory component, is caused by cytokine dysregulation affecting production or response to erythropoietin (EPO) or iron availability or represents a novel pathologic process. Here, we compare a large cohort of AUE cases with a matched, non?anaemic control group and with individuals who have anaemia of defined cause. IL?6, hepcidin, GDF15, EPO and testosterone levels were compared. IL6 and hepcidin levels did not differ significantly between AUE and control groups, indicating that inflammation or iron restriction is not central feature of anaemia in this group. GDF15 levels were significantly elevated when comparing AUE with controls and were markedly elevated in patients with renal disease. Testosterone levels were lower in men from the AUE group compared with non?anaemic controls. EPO levels in the AUE group were increased relative to controls but were inappropriately low for the degree of anaemia. Our data indicate that an impaired EPO response, in the absence of evidence for iron restriction or inflammation, is characteristic of AUE."},{"id":"EekqNGIVm-6yB4eEKom3Nw","title":"SOD2 deficient erythroid cells up-regulate transferrin receptor and down-regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016894","displayDate":"2011-02","description":"Background\nMice irradiated and reconstituted with hematopoietic cells lacking manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) show a persistent hemolytic anemia similar to human sideroblastic anemia (SA), including characteristic intra-mitochondrial iron deposition. SA is primarily an acquired, clonal marrow disorder occurring in individuals over 60 years of age with uncertain etiology.\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nTo define early events in the pathogenesis of this murine model of SA, we compared erythroid differentiation of Sod2-/- and normal bone marrow cells using flow cytometry and gene expression profiling of erythroblasts. The predominant transcriptional differences observed include widespread down-regulation of mitochondrial metabolic pathways and mitochondrial biogenesis. Multiple nuclear encoded subunits of complexes I-IV of the electron transport chain, ATP synthase (complex V), TCA cycle and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins were coordinately down-regulated in Sod2-/- erythroblasts. Despite iron accumulation within mitochondria, we found increased expression of transferrin receptor, Tfrc, at both the transcript and protein level in SOD2 deficient cells, suggesting deregulation of iron delivery. Interestingly, there was decreased expression of ABCb7, the gene responsible for X-linked hereditary SA with ataxia, a component required for iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis.\nConclusions/Significance\nThese results indicate that in erythroblasts, mitochondrial oxidative stress reduces expression of multiple nuclear genes encoding components of the respiratory chain, TCA cycle and mitochondrial protein synthesis. An additional target of particular relevance for SA is iron:sulfur cluster biosynthesis. By decreasing transcription of components of cluster synthesis machinery, both iron utilization and regulation of iron uptake are impacted, contributing to the sideroblastic phenotype."},{"id":"EekqNJr79BOdUjaMQGHhMA","title":"Structural insights into Nox2 and Nox4 – Motifs involved in function and cellular localization","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2815567/","displayDate":"2010-02","description":"Regulated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is primarily accomplished by NADPH oxidases (Nox). Nox1 to Nox4 form a membrane-associated heterodimer with p22phox, creating the docking site for assembly of the activated oxidase. Signaling specificity is achieved by interaction with a complex network of cytosolic components. Nox4, an oxidase linked to cardiovascular disease, carcinogenesis, and pulmonary fibrosis, deviates from this model by displaying constitutive H2O2 production without requiring known regulators. Extensive Nox4/Nox2 chimera screening was initiated to pinpoint structural motifs essential for ROS generation and Nox subcellular localization. In summary, a matching B loop was crucial for catalytic activity of both Nox enzymes. Substitution of the carboxyl terminus was sufficient for converting Nox4 into a phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-inducible phenotype, while Nox2-based chimeras never gained constitutive activity. Changing the Nox2 but not the Nox4 amino terminus abolished ROS generation. The unique heterodimerization of a functional Nox4/p22phox Y121H complex was dependent on the D loop.

Nox4, a Nox linked to cardiovascular disease, angiogenesis, and insulin signaling, is unique in its ability to produce hydrogen peroxide constitutively. To date, p22phox constitutes the only identified regulatory component for Nox4 function. To delineate structural elements in p22phox essential for formation and localization of the Nox4-p22phox complex and its enzymatic function, truncation and point mutagenesis was used. Human lung carcinoma cells served as a heterologous expression system, since this cell type is p22phox-deficient and promotes cell surface expression of the Nox4-p22phox heterodimer. Expression of p22phox truncation mutants indicates that the dual tryptophan motif contained in the N-terminal amino acids 6-11 is essential, whereas the C terminus (amino acids 130-195) is dispensable for Nox4 activity. Introduction of charged residues in domains predicted to be extracellular by topology modeling was mostly tolerated, whereas the exchange of amino acids in predicted membrane-spanning domains caused loss of function or showed distinct differences in p22phox interaction with various Noxs. For example, the substitution of tyrosine 121 with histidine in p22phox, which abolished Nox2 and Nox3 function in vivo, preserved Nox4 activity when expressed in lung cancer cells. Many of the examined p22phox mutations inhibiting Nox1 to -3 maturation did not alter Nox4-p22phox association, further accenting the differences between Noxs. These studies highlight the distinct interaction of the key regulatory p22phox subunit with Nox4, a feature which could provide the basis for selective inhibitor development."},{"id":"EekqNQSbv4iCUHQQHNWEsA","title":"P21- activated kinase is required for mitotic progression and regulates Plk1","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/onc2008131","displayDate":"2008-08","description":"P21-activated kinases (Paks), a family of serine/threonine kinases, are effectors of the Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1. Mammalian Pak1 and Pak homologs in simple eukaryotes are implicated in controlling G2/M transition and/or mitosis. Another serine/threonine kinase, polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), is an important regulator of mitotic events, such as centrosome maturation, mitotic entry, spindle formation, sister chromatid cohesion and cytokinesis. Plk1 phosphorylation is thought to be one of the critical regulatory events leading to these Plk1-mediated functions. We show here that Pak1 is required for cell proliferation, mitotic progression and Plk1 activity in HeLa cells. Gain or loss of Pak function directly impacted phosphorylation and activity of Plk1. Phosphorylation of Plk1 on Ser 49 is important for metaphase-associated events. Inhibition of Pak activity leads to delay in G2/M progression and abnormal spindle formation, mirroring some attributes of Plk1 deregulation. Our results reveal a role for Pak in regulating Plk1 activity and mitotic progression, and connect Pak to the complex protein interaction network enabling cell division."},{"id":"EekqNVXb68Oi952fZH6vpQ","title":"Deletion mutagenesis of p22phox subunit of flavocytochrome b558: identification of regions critical for gp91phox maturation and NADPH oxidase activity","url":"http://www.jbc.org/content/281/41/30336.long","displayDate":"2006-10","description":"The heterodimeric flavocytochrome b558, comprised of the two integral membrane proteins p22phox and gp91phox, mediates the transfer of electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase to generate the superoxide precursor of microbicidal oxidants. This study uses deletion mutagenesis to identify regions of p22phox required for maturation of gp91phox and for NADPH oxidase activity. N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal deletions of human p22phox were generated and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells with transgenes for gp91phox and two other NADPH oxidase subunits, p47phox, and p67phox. The results demonstrate that p22phox-dependent maturation of gp91phox carbohydrate, cell surface expression of gp91phox, and the enzymatic function of flavocytochrome b558 are closely correlated. Whereas the 5 N-terminal and 25 C-terminal amino acids are dispensable for these functions, the N-terminal 11 amino acids of p22phox are required, as is a hydrophilic region between amino acids 65 and 90. Upon deletion of 54 residues at the C terminus of p22phox (amino acids 142–195), maturation and cell surface expression of gp91phox was still preserved, although NADPH oxidase activity was absent, as expected, due to removal of a proline-rich domain between amino acids 151–160 that is required for recruitment of p47phox. Antibody binding studies indicate that the extreme N terminus of p22phox is inaccessible in the absence of cell permeabilization, supporting a model in which both the N- and C-terminal domains of p22phox extend into the cytoplasm, anchored by two membrane-embedded regions."},{"id":"EekqNYPARWGyB4eEKom3Nw","title":"Transport of the IgE receptor alpha-chain is controlled by a multicomponent intracellular retention signal.","url":"http://www.jbc.org/content/281/15/10448.full","displayDate":"2006-02","description":"The human high affinity IgE receptor (Fc?RI) is a central component of the allergic response and is expressed as either a trimeric ??2 or tetrameric ???2 complex. It has been previously described that the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the ?-chain carries a dilysine motif at positions -3/-7 from the C terminus that functions in intracellular retention prior to assembly with other Fc?RI subunits. In this report we have further explored the role of the -3/-7 dilysine signal in controlling steady-state ?-chain transport by mutational analysis and found little surface expression of a -3/-7 dialanine ?-chain mutant but significant Golgi localization. We compared the transport properties of a series of ?-chain cytoplasmic domain truncation mutants and observed that truncation mutants lacking 23 or more C-terminal residues showed a dramatic increase in steady-state transport suggesting a role for the membrane-proximal CD sequence in ?-chain retention. By performing alanine-scanning mutagenesis we identified a dilysine sequence (Lys212-Lys216) proximal to the transmembrane domain (TMD) that is important for both ?-chain cell-surface expression and intracellular stability. Furthermore, co-mutation of the Lys212-Lys216 residues with the -3/-7 dilysine signal produced a dramatic increase in ?-chain surface expression that was further increased by co-mutation of the lone charged residue (Asp192) in the TMD thereby defining three regions that function to regulate ?-chain transport and in a highly synergistic manner."},{"id":"EekqNaiGVcCnt9x7tzCqKQ","title":"Functional analysis of Nox4 reveals unique characteristics compared to other NADPH oxidases.","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898656805000732","displayDate":"2006-01","description":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important signal transduction molecules in ligand-induced signaling, regulation of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and motility. Recently NADPH oxidases (Nox) homologous to Nox2 (gp91phox) of phagocyte cytochrome b558 have been identified, which are an enzymatic source for ROS generation in epithelial cells. This study was undertaken to delineate the requirements for ROS generation by Nox4. Nox4, in contrast to other Nox proteins, produces large amounts of hydrogen peroxide constitutively. Known cytosolic oxidase proteins or the GTPase Rac are not required for this activity. Nox4 associates with the protein p22phox on internal membranes, where ROS generation occurs. Knockdown and gene transfection studies confirmed that Nox4 requires p22phox for ROS generation. Mutational analysis revealed structural requirements affecting expression of the p22phox protein and Nox activity. Mechanistic insight into ROS regulation is significant for understanding fundamental cell biology and pathophysiological conditions."},{"id":"EekqNd00guiejhQkRzrmCQ","title":"A Dictyostelium long chain fatty acyl coenzyme A-synthetase mediates fatty acid retrieval from endosomes","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171933504703210","displayDate":"2003-11","description":"We have identified a subset of Dictyostelium endosomes that carry a long chain fatty acyl coenzyme A-synthetase (LC-FACS 1) on their cytosolic surface. Immunofluorescence studies and observations using GFP-fusion proteins collectively suggest that LC-FACS 1 associates with endosomes a few minutes after their formation, remains bound through the acidic phase of endocytic maturation and dissociates early in the phase where the endosomal content is neutralised prior to exocytosis. Mutants in the fcsA gene, encoding the LC-FACS 1 protein, were constructed by homologous recombination. These cells show a strong defect in the intracellular accumulation of fatty acids, either taken up together with the liquid medium or bound to the surface of particles. Because the mutant cells are otherwise fully competent for macropinocytosis and phagocytosis, we conclude that the LC-FACS 1 protein mediates the retrieval of fatty acids from the lumen of endosomes into the cytoplasm."}],"highlightedWords":["data","scientists","datas","scientist"]},{"accountKey":"d588025228bcdfb0","id":"EenlJQHMCG6fg8uqcmYuvw","updatedDate":"October 2, 2019","fullName":"Data Scientist, Enterprise Data Warehouse","firstName":"Data Scientist, Enterprise Data Warehouse","headline":"Data Scientist, Enterprise Data Warehouse - Henry Ford Health System","location":"Detroit, MI","summary":"","email":"","phoneNumber":"","additionalInformation":"Platform (2y), Azure (1y) DevOps: Docker (3y), Kubernetes (1y), Airflow (2y) Big <span class=\"hl\">Data</span>: Apache Spark (4y), Hadoop (3y) Rapid prototyping: Solidworks (2y), 3D...
