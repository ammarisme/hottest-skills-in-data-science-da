In 2012, approximately 155 million metric tons CO2 equivalent (MMt CO2e) of CH4 were emitted as a result of inadvertent leakage and routine venting. In the same year, the natural gas industry emitted a similar amount of CO2 (approximately 164 MMt CO2e), primarily from the combustion of natural gas that is used as a fuel for compression and flared gas but also from the removal of non-hydrocarbon gases from raw gas by processing plants. Combined, these “midstream” and “upstream” emissions from natural gas infrastructure accounted for approximately 20% of total 2012 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from natural gas systems; the other 80% of GHG emissions from natural gas result from gas combustion by end-use consumers. The Sankey diagrams in this paper examine these emissions in some detail, focusing in particular on the production, processing, transmission and storage, and distribution segments of natural gas infrastructure."},{"id":"EehZWQf0HAa9rBs0yVzk5Q","title":"Department of Energy Critical Materials Stategy","url":"https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/DOE_CMS2011_FINAL_Full.pdf","displayDate":"","description":""},{"id":"Eeh7rrSLFnGUuQ2SBVVUiQ","title":"Power Plant Operations Effect on Water Use for Thermoelectric Power","url":"http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2653553","displayDate":"2017-03","description":"A new dataset released by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) — which combines water withdrawal, electricity generation, and plant configuration data into a single database — enables detailed examination of cooling system operation at thermoelectric plants at multiple scales, most importantly at the unit level. This dataset was used to explore operations across the population of U.S. thermoelectric plants, leading to the conclusion that roughly 32% of all thermoelectric water withdrawal occurs while power plants are not generating electricity. Based on interviews with industry representatives, a unit’s location on the dispatch curve will largely dictate how the cooling system is operated. Peaking plants and intermediate plants might keep their cooling system running to maintain dispatchability. Other considerations include minimizing wear and tear on the pumps and controlling water chemistry."}],"highlightedWords":["data","scientists","datas","scientist"]},{"accountKey":"b8b5931cb8246ff1","id":"EenlT6r8KUahcr3AuI-qMw","updatedDate":"October 2, 2019","fullName":"Data Scientist","firstName":"Data Scientist","headline":"Data Scientist/ Data Analyst","location":"Dallas, TX","summary":"• Overall 7  years of experienced working as a Data Scientist/Data Analyst/Data Modeling with emphasis on Data Mapping, Data Validation in Data Warehousing Environment.\n• Extensively experienced in business intelligence (and BI technologies) tools such as OLAP, Data warehousing, reporting and querying tools, Data mining and Spreadsheets\n• Worked on a different type of Python modules such as requests, Boto, flake8, flask, mock and nose\n• Extensively experienced in business intelligence (and BI technologies) tools such as OLAP, Data warehousing, reporting and querying tools, Data mining and Spreadsheets\n• Efficient in developing Logical and Physical Data model and organizing data as per the business requirements using Sybase Power Designer, Erwin, ER Studio in both OLTP and OLAP applications\n• Strong understanding of when to use an ODS or data mart or data warehousing.\n• Experienced in employing R Programming, MATLAB, SAS, Tableau, and SQL for data cleaning, data visualization, risk analysis and predictive analytics\n• Adept at using SAS Enterprise suite, R, Python, and Big Data related technologies including Hadoop, Hive, Pig, Sqoop, Cassandra, Oozie, Flume, Map-Reduce and Cloudera Manager for the design of business intelligence applications\n• Ability to provide wing-to-wing analytic support including pulling data, preparing analysis, interpreting data, making strategic recommendations and presenting to client/product teams.\n• Hands-on experience with Machine Learning, Regression Analysis, Clustering, Boosting, Classification, Principal Component Analysis and Data Visualization Tools\n• Strong programming skills in a variety of languages such as Python and SQL.\n• Familiarity with Crystal Reports, and SSRS -
