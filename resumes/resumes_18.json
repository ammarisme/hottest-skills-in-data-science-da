The data comes from a variety of sources, including enterprise systems, traffic analysis, weather forecasts, location information, mobile internet and GPS enabled smartphones. Logistics is a dynamic and complex process which is prone to bottlenecks, particularly in the last mile of a supply chain. The analytics group analyzed and addressed logistics optimization. The goal was to save money and time, avoid late delivery and manage utilization of resources. This included planning routes, managing employment and fleets. Data was utilized on destination locations, the shipping area, parking and time of delivery to prevent backlogs at the unloading point, and ensure deliveries were made at a time when they could be received.\nResponsibilities:\n• Identified and executed process improvements, hands-on in various technologies such as Oracle, Informatica, and Business Objects.\n• Designed data models for operational data store (ODS), online transaction processing (OLTP) systems and dimensional data models using Star and Snowflake Schemas\n• Developed large data sets from structured and unstructured data.

And in each minute, a huge amount of unstructured data is\ngenerated. This data is in the form of text which is gathered from\nforums and social media websites. Such data is termed as big data.\nUser opinions are related to a wide range of topics like politics,\nlatest gadgets and products. These opinions can be mined using\nvarious technologies and are of utmost importance to make\npredictions or for one-to-one consumer marketing since they\ndirectly convey the viewpoint of the masses. Here we propose to\nanalyze the sentiments of Twitter users through their tweets in\norder to extract what they think. We classify their sentiments into\nthree different polarities – “positive”, “negative” and “neutral.”\nSince, 6000 tweets are generated every second and this number is\nincreasing, we need a robust system to process these tweets in\nreal-time. Here, batch-processing would have its limitations and\ntherefore a real-time and fault tolerant system, Apache Storm is\nused. After classifying the tweets, we represent the analysis in the\nform of graphs and charts which will enable our system users to\nunderstand public sentiments on the fly. This process as a whole is\nalso called as Opinion Mining or voice of the customer."}],"highlightedWords":["data","scientists","datas","scientist"]},{"accountKey":"2630fa14648659d0","id":"EeneHLq4RneW-fJPSO3KXw","updatedDate":"September 26, 2019","fullName":"Lead Data Scientist","firstName":"Lead Data Scientist","headline":"Data Scientist","location":"New York, NY","summary":"Data Scientist with 10+ years experience developing machine learning algorithms to drive revenue, increase efficiency, and enhance the portfolio of intellectual property within the enterprise.
