There, I honed my analytical skills by using R and machine learning to analyze large sets of spatial data.\n\nAs a data scientist at San Francisco International Airport, I was responsible for implementing the Airport's big data strategy. I conducted analysis on large data sets and created automated data services leveraging Python and the cloud. I also made results accessible to stakeholders and decision makers through visualizations and presentations. Some major accomplishments are: transforming terabytes of raw aviation data into a relational database format, identifying key methods to improve passenger satisfaction metrics, and developing a data visualization module for a mobile application used by over 2,000 airport staff members.\n\nI strive to continue to grow as a data scientist.
