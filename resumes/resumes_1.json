Data scientist was responsible for recognizing opportunities to improve the prediction of misconduct through the use of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. They are expected to build models that evaluate and improve new compliance regulations implemented by the Feds, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) by combining both unstructured data, using text analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP), and structured data.\nMy role on the project was responsible for performing text analysis, building advanced predictive models and analytics supporting LOBs across the enterprise, and render business intelligence reports from varied data. The insights gleaned from this data were used to determine target markets and their issues, plan supply and demand of financial products and ways to save on costs with predictive analytics as well as reduce risk and examine strategic partnerships.\nThis project includes using machine learning techniques and programming languages to derive relevant analysis and metrics, including building proof of concepts to determine value of implementing in future projects. As part of a team focused on understanding the customer experience across the organization, I worked with business partners to understand the business objectives, explore data sources and build NLP/ML solutions.
