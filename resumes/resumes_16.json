Forty-two soldier volunteers were assigned to either a temporal training intervention (TTI) group (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;19) or a control (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;23) group. Outcome measures were simple reaction time (SRT) and running memory continuous performance (RMCP). No significant difference were found in group, time, or group x time (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.05). While not reaching statistical significance, the following were considered of practical relevance for soldiers in combat. Those receiving TTI reduced their mean correct SRT, while the control groups’ reaction time increased. For RMCP, the number of correct responses per unit of time increased for the TTI group and decreased for controls. A trend was shown for temporal training improving service members’ reaction times and running memory."},{"id":"Eem_rP6RW9uZxL7OKloqBw","title":"Dehydroepiandrosterone administration as a prophylaxis against acute stress reactivity in military personnel.","url":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-94391-6_15","displayDate":"2018","description":"Stress in an inherent part of military operations that can impair or even compromise the readiness of military forces. Recent demands for multiple deployments amplify service member stress through family separation, chaos of the battlefield, and facing the death and injury of fellow-service members, and risks of the same for themselves. Dealing with stress takes a toll physically, emotionally, and morally, and exposure to recurrent and acute stressors may lead to stress-related ailments. In turn, widespread stress-related problems can burden the military health system and degrade the performance and readiness of our forces. Therefore, methods that allow for the successful mitigation and/or prevention of stress are highly desirable. This paper provides a literature review, along with a proposed research concept that would investigate the possibility of utilizing a well-known dietary supplement, DHEA, as a prophylaxis against acute stress for military personnel. Methods for testing this approach and its possible impact are discussed."},{"id":"Eem_rTakN6mZM3C-SdzVig","title":"Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI): Human factors assessment","url":"https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a549141.pdf","displayDate":"2011","description":"The purpose of this human factors assessment is to identify the human use issues associated with using the Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM).

Mindfulness and Resilience are positively correlated to one another in research focused on civilian populations. Since mindfulness can be learned, if the correlations remain consistent over time, then perhaps resilience can be increased by learning to be mindful. However, no published research has investigated the relationship between mindfulness and resilience among military active duty and veteran populations who have not undergone mindfulness training. Thirty active duty and veteran service members volunteered and completed the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) and the Resilience Scale, while 29 fully completed the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Results reveal significant correlations between resilience scores and three of the FFMQ scale (Describe, Conscious Action, and Non-Reactive, p &lt; .05), but not with the overall FFMQ, the other two facets (Observe and Non-Discrimination of the FFMQ), and not with the MAAS (p &gt; .05). These results provide initial information on the relationship between mindfulness and resilience among active duty military and veterans, revealing that only some aspects of mindfulness appear related to, and predictive of, resilience. Should the relationships be consistent over time, then instruction in mindfulness may ultimately impact resilience, however additional research is necessary."},{"id":"Eem_rZ8hB8aOMeUoussUZQ","title":"How do I handle my life now?

Active duty and veteran volunteers (n=77) took the PTSD Checklist – Military Version (PCL-M), 26 were identified as having high PTSD scores (+PTSD) and 51 were identified as having low scores, such that they would not be suspected of having PTSD (-PTSD).
