The data contained tweets that achieved a significant level of exposure and was manually labelled into misinformation and regular information. We found that misinformation was produced by accounts that exhibit different characteristics and behaviour from regular accounts. Moreover, the content of misinformation is more novel, polarised and appears to change through coordination. Our findings suggest that engineering of political misinformation seems to exploit human traits such as reciprocity and confirmation bias. We argue that investigating how misinformation is created is essential to understand human biases, diffusion and ultimately better produce public policy."}],"highlightedWords":["data","scientists","datas","scientist"]},{"accountKey":"dcbabeb94e9dab26","id":"Eem5OXKL9MutjnyfqOqOpg","updatedDate":"September 12, 2019","fullName":"Data Scientist Intern","firstName":"Data Scientist Intern","headline":"Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer","location":"Chicago, IL","summary":"Data Scientist with a background in software engineering.
